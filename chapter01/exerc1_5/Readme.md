Change the Lissajous programâ€™s color palette to green on black, for added authenticity. To create the web color `#RRGGBB`, use `color.RGBA{0xRR, 0xGG, 0xBB, 0xff}`, where each pair of hexadecimal digits represents the intensity of the red, green, or blue component of the pixel.

There's a problem running this program on Windows using Powershell. Running in the `cmd.exe` with `go run lissajous.go > out.gif` works properly.
